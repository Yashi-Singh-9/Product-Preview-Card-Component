## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) - Font used for headings and buttons
- [Fraunces](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fraunces) - Font used for product name and price

### What I Learned

Working on this project, I enhanced my skills in:

- Using CSS Flexbox to create a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.
- Implementing CSS Grid for complex layouts and aligning items.
- Managing font styles and incorporating custom fonts into a project.
- Ensuring accessibility by adding meaningful aria-labels to interactive elements.

Here's an example of CSS I’m particularly proud of:

```css
button {
    background-color: var(--dark-cyan);
    color: var(--white);
    border: none;
    border-radius: 10px;
    padding: 15px 60px;
    font-size: 1em;
    font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 18px;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
    font-weight: 700;
    top: 105px;
    position: relative;
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to focus on:

- Improving my knowledge of advanced CSS techniques, such as animations and transitions.
- Exploring more about responsive design and media queries to handle various screen sizes and orientations.
- Enhancing my JavaScript skills to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to my components.
