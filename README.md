## Installation and Running

To view and run this project locally, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Node.js and npm** (for SCSS compilation, optional if you're modifying the styles)
2. A code editor like **VS Code**.
3. A browser to view the project.

---

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yashi-Singh-9/Product-Preview-Card-Component.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Product-Preview-Card-Component
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies (Optional for SCSS Compilation)**:

   If you need to modify or recompile SCSS, install the required dependencies. Run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Ensure you have `node-sass` installed globally or locally to compile SCSS to CSS.

4. **Compile SCSS (Optional)**:

   If you make changes to the SCSS file, run:

   ```bash
   npm run scss
   ```

   This will compile the `styles.scss` file into `styles.css`.

5. **Run the Project**:

   Open the `index.html` file in your browser directly or use a live server extension in VS Code:

   ```bash
   npx live-server
   ```

## My Process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5**
- **SCSS** for styling
- **Bootstrap 5** for layout and responsive design
- **CSS Flexbox** for alignment
- **Mobile-first workflow**
- **Google Fonts**:  
  - [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) for headings and buttons  
  - [Fraunces](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fraunces) for product name and price

---

### What I Learned

Working on this project helped solidify my understanding of:

1. **Responsive Design**:  
   - Leveraging Bootstrap's grid system and utility classes for responsiveness.
   - Using the `picture` element to serve different images for desktop and mobile views.
  
2. **SCSS**:  
   - Organized styling using variables for colors, reusable components, and media queries.
   - Efficient handling of hover effects and transitions.

3. **Accessibility**:  
   - Adding meaningful alt text to images and aria-labels to interactive elements for better accessibility.

---

### Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to focus on:

- Mastering **CSS Grid** and advanced SCSS techniques.
- Incorporating **JavaScript** for interactivity (e.g., animations, user feedback).
- Exploring more advanced **Bootstrap 5 components** for faster development.
